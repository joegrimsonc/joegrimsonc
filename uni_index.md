# My University Work

This is an index for the work that I've produced throughout my time at Abertay University. All of the projects/assignments, organized by year and semester, can be found below.

DISCLAIMER: All the work shown throughout these belongs solely to myself, and is shown here purely for educational and display purposes.

NOTE: All the work will be retrieved and sorted in time, but 3rd and 4th year work will be prioritized since those are the years that contributed to the degree classification.

#### CMP308- Professional Project Planning and Prototyping

- Grade: A
- Description: "The aim of this module is to provide you with the ability to operate professionally as a subject specialist within a team and in interaction with project stakeholders, and understand principles of project management. Throughout the module you will be working in a team to work on a project." I had the role of Project Manager within the team of 6.
    - Coursework:
        - Unit 1 (30%): A presentation providing an overview of objectives, deliverables, approach, costs and skills.
        - Unit 2 (70%): Project proposal, outlining how the team will deliver the project that is worked on for CMP311 (as CMP311 follows from where this module stops). The proposal consisted of two parts: a business case and a management plan. The sections I was responsible for (in the business case) were the project overview, strategic alignment, cost/benefit analysis, alternatives analysis and approvals.
- NOTE: Unfortunately, I cannot show or describe the coursework in detail until 2028 due to an agreement with the university and external partner.

#### CMP314- Computer Networking 2

- Grade: A
- Description: "This module introduces the ideas and concepts of how computers, mobile devices and gadgets communicate via a wide range of communications technologies with each other and other devices. This will include interactions via technologies such as Ethernet, VLANS, STP, Wireless, Routing, Subnetting, IPv6, SNMP, DHCP, DNS, Firewalls and Network Management."
- Coursework:
    - Unit 1 (100%): A report on Acme. Inc's network, including a detailed network diagram/topography, subnets in use, evaluating security weaknesses (via practical work) and a critical evaluation of network design. Acme. Inc's network was provided via a virtual machine.
        - The report from this unit can be found [here](https://github.com/joegrimsonc/uni_work/blob/main/2001621_CMP314_U1.pdf).

#### CMP319- Web Application Penetration Testing

- Grade: A
- Description: "The aim of this assessment is to conduct a comprehensive web application penetration test of a website then produce a document explaining your methodology, findings, and evaluate the process." The assessment was was black box, coming from the perspective of an attacker who had a valid account on the web application. The simulated attack was to target the web application only (i.e not the operating system).
- Coursework:
    - Unit 1 (100%): A report on the completed web application penetration test, so that the fictional owner of the website could improve security based on recommendations and that other professionals could re-create the work based on practical documentation.
        - The report from this unit can be found [here](https://github.com/joegrimsonc/uni_work/blob/main/2001621_CMP319_U1.pdf).
