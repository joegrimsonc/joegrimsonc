# My University Work Archive

This is an index for the work that I've produced throughout my time at Abertay University. All of the projects/assignments, organized by year and semester, can be found below.

DISCLAIMER: All the work shown throughout these belongs solely to myself, and is shown here purely for educational and display purposes.

NOTE: All the work will be retrieved and sorted in time, but 3rd and 4th year work will be prioritized since those are the years that contributed to the degree classification.
